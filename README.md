# Mario_trivia_game

This game is a Mario themed timed trivia game. The motivation behind this was my love for Mario games, and to challenge people on their
knowledge of Mario lore. To start the game the user simply cicks the start button in the middle of the page. After clicking start the user has 30 seconds to anwser 8 questions. Some of the questions are pretty easy, and some of the are very hard. When the time is up your selections are submitted, and you are given the total amount of correct anwsers, incorrect anwsers, and the amount of questions you didn't guess.This game was built to practice my skills with JavaScript timers.
